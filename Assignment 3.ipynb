    "1. How do these results compare to the results using a linear model in the previous assignment? Use values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are much better than that of a linear model used in previous assignment. The R2 score achived by a linear model are only 0.61 and 0.62 for training and testing score respectively. In the tree base model, the worst training and testing scores are 0.83 and 0.74 (about 20% better than linear model) while the best scores are 0.95 and 0.9 (about 45% better)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Out of the models you tested, which model would you select for this dataset and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the the results table, the gradient bossting machine model gives the best score, the random forest are second best and single decision tree ranks bottom. However, the scores achieved from the GB model are only about 2% higher than that of the RF, which is insignificant. Since GB requires careful tuning of the parameters, which can be difficult to do, while RF is tuning-free*, I will choose random forest for this dataset because it is simpler to execute and the results achieve is as good as the best model and about 20% better than a single decision tree.\n",
    "*source: https://fastml.com/what-is-better-gradient-boosted-trees-or-random-forest/\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you wanted to increase the accuracy of the tree-based models, what would you do? Provide two suggestions.\n",
    "To improve the accuracy, we can:\n",
    " - increase the the number of n_estimators as more trees will provide better result with a better average scores. Note that this would take longer\n",
    " - tuning the max_depth of the trees to find an optimized number of depth\n",
    " - tuning the number of features used, as max_features determines how random each tree is, and a smaller max_features reduces overfitting\n",

    "### Questions (6 marks)\n",
    "1. How do the training and validation accuracy change depending on the method used? Explain with values.\n",
    "The decision tree classifier did very well with a training score of 1.0 and a accuracy score of 0.9. It did excellent in learning the model and predicting the value. On the other hand, the support vector machine models did poorly compared to the DTC. The training score and accuracy score drops drastically over 30% to 0.68 for both score. Note that the variance is extremely low for both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are two reasons why the support vector machines model did not work as well as the tree-based model?\n",
    "\n",
    " - The decision boundary created by the SVM is most likely non-linear.The SVM adds non-linear features in the model, and it is possible that the dataset used is better fit with linear features.\n",
    " - Another possible cause is the data was not preprocessed properly, and the hyper -parameters were not tuned properly. The SVM required the parameters to be tuned carefully for it to work.\n",
    " \n",
    "3. How many samples were incorrectly classified in step 5.2? \n",
    "Three samples were incorrectly classified accoridng to the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In this case, is maximizing precision or recall more important? Why?\n",
    "In this case, it doesn't really matter whether maximizing precision or recall. They are equally important, as I don't see why it is important to correctly classify a wine unless there is an economic value. As stated in the source of the data site \"These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Precision focuses on false positive i.e. a wine classfied as positive category but it is not (for eg, it is classified as class 1, but belongs to class 2 or 3). Recall focuses on false negative i.e. a wine classified in a negative class, but it is not (for eg it is not classified in class 1, (i.e. classified in class 2 or 3), but it is actually class 1). Assuming class 1 wine is a lot more expensive ( and expensive enough to make an impact) than the other two classes , maximizing precisons means minimize the chances of selling \"fake\" wine ( aka selling a cheap wine at a much higher price), while maximizing recall means minimizing in loss of revenue. The former is reputation and risk of being sued, while the later is money which are equally improtant in my opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a second thought, I won't spend money on wine anyway, so it doesn't matter to me.\n",

    "1.Where did you source your code?\n",

    "I found the source code in the example provided in the jupyter notebook. The coding part is not difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In what order did you complete the steps?\n",
    "\n",
    "I follow the order in the Machine Leanring Workflow which is also the steps of the instruction. Loading data, inspect and cleaning data, load the model and instantiate the ML model, split the data into train and test, validate the model and visualize the results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you used generative AI, what prompts did you use? Did you need to modify the code at all? Why or why not?\n",
    "I did not use AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Did you have any challenges? If yes, what were they? If not, what helped you to be successful?\n",
    "\n",
    "I found it's a challenge to read and intepret the confusion matrix for multiclass. It's easy to identified TP，TN, FP and FN in a binary matrix. I did some google and found a very good website explaining it https://www.evidentlyai.com/classification-metrics/confusion-matrix I have a very good understanding about confustion matrix and its metrics of recall and precision. However, I still have a hard time to decide whether recall or precision is more important as it depends on the actual kind of data model. In this assignment, predicting a wine class, I don't really see the importance whether a type of wine is correctly classified."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I notice that it's important to choose the right model for the datasets. A linear models for linear data and vice versa. In the concrete examples, a linear model did very poorly (accuracy score of 0.6, while the non-linear (tree, forest and grbt) did very well (accuracy score between 0.7 to 0.9). The data source mentioned that there are non-linear features existed in the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also notice that a more complex model doesn't neccessary mean a better result. As in the concrete examples in part 1, random forest gradient boosting model generate about the same result (0.88 vs 0.9). In the wine example, the decision tree is better than the support vector (0.9 vs 0.7 scores) noted that decision tree doesn't required hyper parameter tuning, while the other two do need a careful tuning. Decision tree is considered less powerful than the other two, but it is easier to work with. So always start with a simple model first is the key idea discusse in class. "
